							<u> What is the Internet Of Things?</u><br>
							<br>
							The Internet Of Things is a development  of the Internet in which  everyday objects can be connected to a network, allowing them to send and get information. Everyday objects can be for examples, fridges that you can access the Internet on, coffee machines that can be controlled by our mobile devices, smart cars, light bulbs that we can control with our devices. Devices such as IPads, IPhones, Apple watches and other devices. Smart home devices is one of developed section within the Internet of Things. The international research firm Gartner predicts that by 2020  <i>"there will be &apos;25 billion&apos; of these smart devices, transmitting tiny amounts of data to us, to the cloud and to each other". (The Globe and Mail. (2017). Eight ways the Internet of Things will change the way we live and work. [online] Available at: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/the-future-is-smart/article24586994/ [Accessed 4 Jan. 2017] )</i><br>

							<br>One example of the smart light bulbs from the &apos;Philips&apos;s Hue range which they have has changed the way we interact with our homes. Not only we can control them with our phones but we can use voice commands by other smart devices connected to the bridge. For example &apos;Amazon Echo&apos; which you can connect it to your hue bridge and control the hue lights with your voice. On the &apos;Philips&apos;s website it talks about how the Internet of Things has empowered us all.The website also goes through how <i>"The &apos;Internet of Things&apos; has become central to how we innovate at Philips - and how we listen to, engage with and take inspiration from our consumers."</i>
							<i>(Philips. (2017). How the Internet of Things empowers us all. [online] Available at: http://www.philips.com/a-w/innovationmatters/blog/how-the-internet-of-things-empowers-us-all.html [Accessed 4 Jan. 2017].)</i><br>
							<br>
							Another device is called &apos;Nest&apos; which is a smart home product that understands what temperatures you like, it can turn itself off, it can lower the temperature when you're away and it can be controlled from anywhere over Wi-Fi with your mobile devices. And also many other products are smart Samsung TV's notifying you that your washing machine is finished and etc. The advantage of all of these products is that it makes our lives so much easier in ways we interact with our homes but there can be many downsides to it.<br>
							<br>Many disadvantages can be is that all of these realms within the Internet of Things can be vulnerable. IT expert have shown us  how easy it is for hackers to hack into many of smart home gadgets and have access to the software in smart cars. Which will allow them to take control of the cars speed, brakes and steering which can be dangerous for us. Overall I believe that the Internet of things will have so much in store for us in the future, and will change they way we work in our daily lives.</i>
