				<u>What is Web 2.0?</u><br>
				<br>
				"Web 2.0 doesn't refer to any changes in the internet's architecture. Rather, it refers to the types of software employed and changes at the level of user practices." (Hinton, S. and Hjorth, L, 2013)<br>
				<br>Web 2.0 is the second devolvement of the internet, which is more of a user generated content. In 2004, the term began to be recognized when Tim O'Reilly Media and MediaLive hosted a conference about Web 2.0. John Battelle and Tim O'Reilly explained their differences between the Web 2.0 and Web 1.0. Where software applications are built on the Web rather than the desktop. One thing Tim O'Reilly argued is that "customers are building your business for you". Some of the key characteristics of Web 2.0 is that it allows us to interact with each other on social media networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and many other social media platforms which  allows users to create and personalize their own page and communicate with friends.<br>
				<br>Web 2.0 also allows us to collaborate with each in real time, being able to post and update blogs on the web. On Wikipedia users can now  add and update online content on Wikipedia compared to Web 1.0 where it was all &apos;read only content&apos;. Also Web applications are popular nowadays where users can easily run programs directly on the Web browser than the desktop itself.<br>
				<br>
				Another important thing about Web 2.0 is that users are not just consumers; they have become producers or co-producers of what contents they are giving on the web. For example media sites such as YouTube we are no longer just watching YouTube videos we can also produce our own content and upload them on YouTube for the user&apos;s watch. Which now YouTube has become a career for some people and you can make money out of creating content on YouTube. One famous YouTuber called &apos;Pewdiepie&apos; who has 52,077,995 subscribers on his YouTube page with now a net worth of $90 million.
				<br>

				<br>
				<u>Web 2.0 and Social Media</u>
				<br>
				<br>
				Social media which is a big part of Web 2.0 which again supports user-generated content, but also focuses on the users by letting the users create various content to share on there social networking sites. Facebook is a social networking site was launched on 4th February, 2004. Which was created by Mark Zuckerberg,Facebook is the largest social networking site in the UK and USA with 835 million users worldwide in March 2012 <i>(Dijck, J. 2013)</i><br>
				<br>Zuckerberg stated in the &apos;Times Magazine&apos; that "the default is social" in order to <i> "make the world more open and connected".(http://content.time.com/<br>time/magazine/article/0,9171,1990798,00.html)</i> Which his statement he made, became true as everyone nowadays are connected online and open on the web. Which led to other developers following his direction and expand the social media universe. Overall Web 2.0 is sharing information as well as interacting with the users.<br>
