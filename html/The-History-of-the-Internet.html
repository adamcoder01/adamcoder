			<u>The History of the Internet?</u> 
			<br><br>      <i>"The Internet is a loose arrangement of connected but autonomous networks of devices"</i><i>(Ryan, J. 2010)</i> The events leading up to the invention of the internet was during the cold war between the United states and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.<br><br> The Internet itself did not only have just one inventor the internet developed through time. In 1957 the Soviet Union launched the first satellite Sputnik. Due to this invention the United States was shocked by the Soviet Union's technological advancement. They then started to think more about technology and its benefits to the world which made the Defence Department of the United states launched the Advanced Research Projects Agency known as ARPA <i>"with the task of mobilizing research resources, particular from the university world, towards building technological military superiority over the Soviet Union"</i><i>(Castells, M. 2001)</i>.Arpanet was made to communicate between ARPA computer terminals during the 1960s, one of the important elements that was needed during the creation of the Arpanet was the to link two computers together. This would allow users to have access to different computers and data without having to use the cost of travel.<br><br>

			Military experts and scientist were concerned about what could happen if the Soviet attacks the nation&apos;s telephone system. In 1965, a scientist named Paul Baran created a way of sending information from one computer to another, which he called it "Packet Switching." Packet Switching is where data breaks down into pieces, before sending it to its required destination. That way the individual packets can take its own route from place to place. In 1969 the Arpanet sent its first message to SRI International from the University of California, Los Angeles. The message said &apos;Login&apos;, but then it crashed all of a sudden.The Stanford computer only got the first two letters.<i>(History, T. (2017). ARPANET launch the world's first successful packet-switched wide area computer network - Computing History. [online] Computinghistory.org.uk. Available at: <a href="http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/5613/ARPANET-launch-the-world-s-first-successful-packet-switched-wide-area-computer-network/">http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/5613/ARPANET-launch-the-world-s-first-successful-packet-switched-wide-area-computer-network/</a> [Accessed 8 Jan. 2017].)</i> Without this method of packet switching, the government&apos;s computer network would be defenseless from attacks.<br>

			<br>
			In the 1970s the network grew and packet-switched computer networks doubled, it became more difficult for them to combine into a single worldwide &apos;Internet&apos;. Later on Vinton Cerf a computer scientist solved the problem by creating a way for all of the computers to communicate with each other. He named it &apos;Transmission Control Protocol&apos; which is short for TCP. Which allowed  different computers to each other from a distance. But then in 1991 the Internet changed again....
