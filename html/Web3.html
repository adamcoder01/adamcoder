					<u>What is Web 3.0?</u>
					<br>
					<br>
					Web 3.0 is referred to by the experts as the semantic web. The term semantic means data driven. The data will come from the user and the web will adjust it to meet the needs of the user. For example, if you were shopping online for a "jacket" you will receive advertisements related to the product you are searching. Also when you search for other things as well as the "jacket". For example "House of Fraser" the web will keep in mind that you quite frequently searched for store and will pull up search queries that combine "House of Fraser" and "jacket" on your browser which may interest you.
					<br>
					<br>
					One of the benefits of Web 3.0 is that you are able to use data from anywhere. This is mainly by the use of smart phones and cloud applications. Where users can access much data from anywhere and not just from their homes. Another advantage is that when you are working on the Internet its becomes easier for the user as the Internet is more personalized towards them. Many features of Web 3.0 makes our lives so much easier like the web knowing what content you would like to see saves you time searching for it and also sending other suggestions which you might like. For examples if your watching YouTube videos, similar recommendations to the videos you was recently watching will be recommended for you on your homepage catering to your preferences. Also web apps have become more user-friendly for the users and helpful. For example, Google Maps which is now able to merge location searches with route guidance, street view and live traffic updates. Which was not possible with Web 2.0.The disadvantages of Web 3.0 is that it&apos;s easier to access personal/private information on people will spend more time than ever on the internet.<br>
					<br>
					Tim Berners-Lee named his vision the Semantic Web or known as Web 3.0, which could learn and understand the users context just like personal assistants would do in real life. One example could be Siri, which is a built-in "intelligent assistant" on Apple IPhone 4s to IPhone 7 and then few years after now available on iPads and Macbook. Siri allows users to speak to the phone in order for Siri to listen to them. Users can say such phrases like "Hey Siri, what&apos;s the nearest cinema from here?" and Siri will do the browsing on the web for you based on your location. Which then Siri will reply to what you have commanded, which saves a lot of time rather than browsing yourself. Overall for the future I think Web 3.0 will be more connected, open, smart with semantic web technologies. I wonder what we will see in Web 4.0, what do you think?
