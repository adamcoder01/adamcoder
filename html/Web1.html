					<u>The Invention of the World Wide Web</u><br>
					<br>During the late 80s scientists and researchers were able to send files and data from one computer to another with no problem. But then Tim Berners-Lee a British computer programmer born on June 8 1955 who had a concept of a system, based on the &apos;hypertext&apos; which would allow researchers to access information and share and distribute information, not just within one company but globally around the world. Tim Berners-Lee named it the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee also created the first web browser, editor and the world's first website to be released on August 6 1991. The website explained the World Wide Web and gave the users a brief understanding on how to get started with their own websites.<br>

				   <br><u>What is Web 1.0?</u>
					<br>
					<br>"Web 1.0 is a phantom term, constructed after the event. People did not speak of Web 1.0 until after the concept of Web 2.0 had been defined. <i>(Dijck, J. 2013)</i><br>
					<br>
					Web 1.0 was the first devolvement of the internet; the web was just an information portal back then which was just made up of Web pages connected by hyperlinks.The web focused on mainly businesses displaying their information on their webpages for the users, allowing them to access information and be able to read it on the web. The growth of the web started when more and more people started to use the web which made companies realise and understand the potential that the web has on society. Which more and more media companies started to put content on the web. For example, BBC and CNN and many other sites.(Dijck, J. 2013)</i>
					<br>
					<br>
					The key characteristics of Web 1.0 is that the sites have static pages instead of dynamic HTML. Static pages is where the user can read the text and look at images on the web but you can not click on them to receive more information. Another thing it terms of coding the use of HTML elements (3.2-era) you can use frames and tables to position elements on the page but there was alot of elements we can use that we have today.<br>
					<br>
					Business advertising also had became popular from when the web launched. One company named &apos;WIRED&apos; <i>"claims that it was the first organisation to launch banner ads on its website</i> <i>Hotwired</i> in October 1994" <i>(Clarke 1999)</i>. Due to this new start other companies started to do the same and soon enough more and more people started advertise their banners on websites for the users to see which was an effective way for websites to engage more and more people to see and click on the website and look at it. Which many people did.The main problem of Web 1.0 is that you cannot post your thoughts and be able to write on the web simply just be able to read it. Overall Web 1.0 was all about sharing information to the users but not interacting with it. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Here are some example of web 1.0 websites which you can click and see!
